        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p id="aboutme">
          My name is Chris Back and I have started my transition from the
          finance industry towards the technology industry. I highly believe
          technology is the future as in my previous role as an accountant, many
          thing were already starting to get automated. In order to not fall
          behind, I have decided to enlist in a full-stack web development
          course and will be pursuing a career as a developer.

          <h2>My professional life</h2>
        <p>I worked as a account payables officer for 2.5 years, handling and reconciling over 100 different accounts with three different media types from overseas, digital and radio. I have experience dealing with internal media teams and clients as I had to communicate between them in order to pay invoices. 
        
        After working as an account payables officer, I moved to become an accountant at another firm, where within the 3 months I worked there I helped them set up their overseas office, new overseas accounts and get listed on the New York Stock Exchange. I moved on after only 3 months as I was in the finance industry ever since graduating from university and I  could not see myself having a future in the finance industry as it just did not align with my interests.</p>

          <h2>A little more about me</h2>
          <p>I enjoy the outdoors very much. On the weekends I enjoy going fishing on my boat either in Sydney harbor or Botany Bay. On the off days on the weekend where I am not on the water, I enjoy going on walking tracks around the city. Every now and then, I would take a weekend down at the blue mountains and go exploring the tracks in the area, such as the Three Sisters walking track or the Katoomba waterfall round walking track. 
          As I work a desk job for my entire professional career, I found it was important to go out and stretch your legs and back every day, hence fitness is a big part of my life.</p>
